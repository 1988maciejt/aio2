NLFSR (\textit{Non-Linear Feedback Shift Register}) is very similar to LFSR (\textit{Linear Feedback Shift Register}) with the only difference: feedback taps may be results of a non-linear function of register's flip-flops. Consider the example from Fig. \ref{nlfsr.example}. We can see there a 10-bit register having two taps: \texttt{from FF[4] to a XOR at input of FF[5]} and \textit{from (FF[7] AND FF[3]) to a XOR at input of FF[0])}. This may be strictly implemented using \Nlfsr\ object by:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	MyNLFSR = Nlfsr(10, [ [5, [4]], [0, [3,7]] ])
	#        size >|--|<
	#                   |<------- taps ------->|
	# tap 1: [5, [4]]   : FF[4] to input of FF[5]
	# tap 2: [0. [3,7]] : (FF[3] AND FF[7]) to input of FF[0]
\end{lstlisting}

\label{nlfsr:taps}
If is worth nothing, that tap description of \Nlfsr\ is different than tap description of \Lfsr. The difference is, that while each tap is still defined by a list, but the first item is not a source, but destination tap and the second item is a list of ANDed sources. So, each tap of \Nlfsr\ looks like: \\
\texttt{[ <destination\_FF>, [<source\_FF\_1>, <source\_FF\_2>, ...] ]}.

As you can see, source values may only be ANDed. However, there is still a way to make a tap implementing other nonlinear function. All indexes given in tap list may also be negative numbers. If a source index is negative, then it considers NOT(source). If a destination index is negative, then it considers NAND instead of AND. See example taps description:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{[2, [-3,4]]} - AND(NOT(FF[3]), FF[4]) to a XOR at input of FF[2]
	\item \texttt{[-2, [3,4]]} - NAND(FF[3], FF[4]) to a XOR at input of FF[2]
	\item \texttt{[-2, [-3,-4]]} - NAND(NOT(FF[3]), NOT(FF[4])) = OR(FF[3], FF[4]) to a XOR at input of FF[2]
\end{itemize}

Keep in mind, that there is not any \textit{fast simulation} method for NLFSRs. The only way to determine the period of NLFSR is simply simulate it step-by-step. To make it as fast as possible, he \ShellName\ implements a C++ based subroutine.

\section{Nlfsr object methods}

Not all \Nlfsr\ object methods will be described. \Nlfsr\ class bases on \Lfsr\ class, so almost all methods are inherited from LFSR.

\cmd {Nlfsr\_object} {\_\_init\_\_} {Size, Config=[]} {
	Object initializer.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{Size} - size (flip-flop count) of the NLFSR,
		\item \texttt{Config} - list of taps definition (see page \pageref{nlfsr:taps})
	\end{itemize}
}

\cmd {Nlfsr\_object} {\_\_str\_\_} {} {
	It returns a string containing binary value of the \Nlfsr\ object (left MSb). See also \texttt{Lfsr.\_\_str\_\_} on page \pageref{lfsr:str}
}

\cmd {Nlfsr\_object} {getArchitecture} {} {
	Returns a string containing human-readable description of taps.
}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	MyNLFSR = Nlfsr(10, [ [5, [4]], [0, [3,7]] ])
	print(MyNLFSR.getArchitecture())
	# >>>  0 <=  3 AND 7
	# >>>  5 <=  4
\end{lstlisting}

\cmd {Nlfsr\_object} {getFullInfo} {Header=False} {
	Returns a string containing some information about NLFSR. Dependently on \texttt{Header} value, the first line is a header (see the example below). Next lines are human-readable description of taps. Last four lines are simplified equations - update functions - of the NLFSR. First update function - NLFSR as is; the second - complementary; third - reversed, and finally - reversed-complementary.
}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	MyNLFSR = Nlfsr(10, [ [5, [4]], [0, [3,7]] ])
	print(MyNLFSR.getFullInfo(True))
	# >>>  10-bit NLFSRs  and taps list and equations:
	# >>>  0 <=  3 AND 7
	# >>>  5 <=  4
	# >>> 2, (4, 8)
	# >>> C  2, 4, 8, (4, 8)
	# >>> R 8, (6, 2)
	# >>> CR 2, 6, 8, (6, 2)
\end{lstlisting}

\cmd {Nlfsr\_object} {next} {steps=1} {
	See \texttt{Lfsr.next} on page \pageref{lfsr:next}.
}

\cmd {Nlfsr\_object} {printFullInfo} {} {
	Prints the full information (without header) about the NLFSR. Does the same as \textit{Aio.print(NlfsrObject.getFullInfo(False))}.
}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	MyNLFSR = Nlfsr(10, [ [5, [4]], [0, [3,7]] ])
	MyNLFSR.printFullInfo()
	# >>>  0 <=  3 AND 7
	# >>>  5 <=  4
	# >>> 2, (4, 8)
	# >>> C  2, 4, 8, (4, 8)
	# >>> R 8, (6, 2)
	# >>> CR 2, 6, 8, (6, 2)
\end{lstlisting}
